# My portfolio

## Authors

## Context

The idea for a personal portfolio serves multiple purposes :
- Increased visibility on LinkedIn and the job market in general
- Build a front-end project from the ground up, with the freedom of experimenting with preferred technologies, most notably React

As such, this portfolio is my entryway to show to recruiters who I am, what I've studied and the projects I've worked on ever since the beginning of my studies.

## Features

The responsive website feature six pages :
- A home page featuring a brief introduction and a navigation carousel
- An about me page explaining my motivation for becoming a web developer and talking about my interests
- A projects page summarizing the several projects I've worked on over the years, including web development
- An education page summarizing the degrees I've earned in computer science
- An experience page summarizing the 9 months of professional work I've done for research laboratories and companies
- A contact page where recruiters can reach out to me using my contact information

Navigation is made easier thanks to a navigation menu available at all times, as well as a theme toggle for comfortable browsing.

## Getting started

The website's purpose being a personal portfolio, the website is not to be built, deployed and ran by unauthorzied parties.
